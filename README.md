# bowbend

Bowbend is an async, stream driven, multi-language portscanner.  It is currently pre alpha.  Major, basic features 
are missing.  There are plenty of bugs.  I suggest you not even bother using it yet.  For more information on how to 
work with the project and how its organized, please see the docs folder.

## Contribution
This project is not open for contribution.  It is still moving quickly.  I've got plans on where I want things to 
head that might not be obvious or well documented.  I'd hate for someone's effort to be wasted on code that was just 
meant to be ripped out
